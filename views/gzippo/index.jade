	p gzippo, pronounced g-zippo and created by Tom Gallacher is a gzip&nbsp;
		a(href='http://nodejs.org', target='_blank') NodeJS
		| &nbsp;middleware for 
		a(href='http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/', target='_blank') Connect
		| &nbsp;/
		a(href='http://expressjs.com/') Express
		| &nbsp;using node-compress for much better performace than any other connect gzip or express gzip middleware.
	p The reason behind the performace increase is, unlike the deprecated connect gzip implemention and modules based on
		| this (such as connect-gzip), gzippo does not use child_process.exec to spawn a process, instead using native C++
		| code. gzippo can be found in the node package manager npm.

	h4 Installation
	pre
		code
			$ npm install gzippo
	br
	h4 Usage
	br
	h4 Static Gzip
	br
	p In your express/connect server setup, use as follows:
	pre
		code
			var gzippo = require('gzippo');
			//Replace the default connect or express static provider with gzippo's
			//app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
			app.use(gzippo.staticGzip(__dirname + '/public'));
	br
	h4 Options
	br
	p contentTypeMatch - A regular expression tested against the Content-Type header to determine whether the response should be gzipped or not. The default value is /text|javascript|json/.
	br
	p maxAge - cache-control max-age directive, defaulting to 1 day
	br
	p clientMaxAge - browser cache-control max-age directive, defaulting to 1 week
	br
	p prefix - A url prefix. If you want all your static content in a root path such as /resource/. Any url paths not matching will be ignored
	br
	h4 Streaming Gzip
	br
	p Starting in Connect 2.X Expressjs has the ability to use a streaming gzip module provided natively by connect. This will gzip streaming responses including JSON and html responses. As this 2.X branch is not currently stable I have back ported the compress.js component into gzippo.
	pre
		code
			app.use(gzippo.staticGzip(__dirname + '/public'));
			app.use(gzippo.compress());
	p This has no caching and is currently unsupported as it will be included in a future connect 1.X release, up until then compress.js will be included in gzippo.
