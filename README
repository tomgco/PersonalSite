This is the source to my personal site - http://tomgallacher.info

The site is a terminal emulator written in javascipt with basic functionality.

The current avalible commands are:

 echo - basic echo command
 help - displays help about a command
 make - just don't try to make a sandwich
 clear - clears the current screen buffer
 projects - displays information about the projects I have worked on
